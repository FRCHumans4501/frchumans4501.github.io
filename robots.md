				<h2>Firewall</h2>
				<p>Firewall was our very first robot! Built in <em>six weeks</em> for the FRC 2013 Season, Firewall shot frisbees through a high-powered launcher and caught frisbees with it's net. Firewall performed amazingly, and helped us win Rookie All Star and Highest Rookie Seed at the Los Angeles Regional. Firewall also perfomed at the FIRST World Championships 2013 in St. Louis, Missouri.</p>

				<h2>Skippy</h2>
				<p>Skippy, our second robot, was the second iteraton of Firewall. We took everything we did right with Firewall and refined our ideas into an even better robot! Skippy utilized a mecanum drive train that allowed him to move in any direction. Equiped with the same powerful frisbee launcher, Skippy was a beast to be reckoned with. Skippy performed at the 2013 Fall Classic.</p>

				<h2>Trusspasser</h2>
				<p>Trusspasser was our next robotic endeavour. Built for the FRC 2014 Season, Trusspasser picked up large yoga balls and launched them into high goals! Trusspasser has a piston-powered launcher and carwash-style back loader. Trusspasser was able to pick up, pass, and shoot balls all around the field, especially over the Truss! Trusspasser competed at the 2014 Los Angeles Regional.</p>

				<h2>T-Shirt Bot</h2>
				<p>During Fall 2014, New Roads School asked us to make a T-Shirt cannon to shoot T-Shirts into the crowd at sports events and other gatherings. We took it one step further by attaching our cannon onto a high-speed robot! T-Shirt Bot is able to shoot a single T-Shirt at high speeds using compressed air. Air is compressed on board, as well as off board, to give us lots of power and range. Our goal is to continuously improve T-Shirt Bot over the coming years to become the best T-Shirt Robot around!</p>

				<p>Snowflake was our 2014-2015 robot that competed in the national championships. Snowflake used a high powered motor to lift a pair of grabbers that use pistons to grab a tote and stack them to score points.</p>

				<h2>Prince</h2>
				<p>Prince was our 2015-2016 robot that competed in the game FIRST Stronghold. Prince had used a two speed sonic shifter drive that could provide ether high speed but low torque or with a press of a button low speed but high tourque. We could also shoot "boulders" into a tower using some motors to spin up some wheels to a high rpm and launch the "boulder" into ether high or low goal.</p>
