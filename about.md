The Humans, FRC Team 4501
====

We're the Humans, a FIRST Robotics team based in Santa Monica, California at New Roads School. We strive to provide the members of our community the opportunity to gain technical knowledge, get hands-on experience, and build robots!

Our Rookie Year was in 2013, where we competed in the Los Angeles Regional. We won the Rookie All Star award, as well as the Highest Rookie Seed award. At that time, we had about 15 to 20 members. Now, we have grown to a team of over 35 members! All students at New Roads School are free to drop by our lab in the Huerta room, and students outside the school may contact us if they wish to join our team.

Go Humans!
