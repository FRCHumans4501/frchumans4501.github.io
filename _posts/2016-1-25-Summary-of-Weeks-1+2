As week 2 comes to an end, it comes to my attention that I have not posted anything here so here's a quick summary:
    •Drive Team:
        •Modified prototype drive train
        •Started working on method for getting over the moat
        
    •Electronics:
        •Got encoders on
        
    •Programming:
        •Started work on vision
        •Programmed encoders enough to get values but not effect the driveing
        •Got basic code for the shooter
        
    •Prototyping:
        •Started prototyping a way to shoot the boulders
